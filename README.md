This code was used to process camera images for FRC Team 1418's robot in the 2016 competition, FIRST Stronghold.

The team had a historic season in 2016. They were part of the 1st place alliance at the Greater DC District competition at Battlefield High School, and then proceeded to lead the first place alliances at the Bethesda District competition and the Chesapeake Regional Championship. The team finished the stellar season by making it to quarterfinals at the World Championship in St. Louis.
